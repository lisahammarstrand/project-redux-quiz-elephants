# Redux quiz group project

This is a project built within Technigo frontend boot camp.

This project was an introduction to Redux, and the task was to build a quiz game, with at least 5 questions and multiple choice answers. This was a team project and also a practice in team collaboration.

## How we took on the task

We decided to go with mob programming since it was a new concept and to let everyone get a basic understanding of what was going on. We spent some time on planning or quiz theme and defining which components we would use and what their functions would be. 

A Redux store was pre-defined in the project and also a reducer with a few actions to control the quiz. We worked on using the state to render the quiz questions one at a time, showing the question itself and also the possible answers. The user needs to click an answer before continuing on to the next question.
